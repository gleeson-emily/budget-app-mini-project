# Budget App Mini Project

## Description
This is an in-class mini-project completed for the U of T Full Stack Boot Camp. We were given starter code and required to create a MongoDB database using Mongoose to store and update data.

A nice feature of this budget app is that when the app is disconnected from the internet will store values in the database and update your budget automatically when the connection is restored.

Huge shoutout to my TA Luca, who helped me iron out a few kinks in the code!
